# KTH

Use pandoc to create slides. This is an unofficial KTH theme and doesn't
actually look like the official powerpoint slides.


Files to create slides and handouts from the same Markdown files using
Pandoc and a custom Beamer template. Lots of ideas borrowed from [Karl
Browman's post][] and [Lincoln Mullen's gist][].

Define SLIDES in a local.mk file.
